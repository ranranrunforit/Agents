This project builds, evaluates, and improves an email assistant. The assistant is designed to automate email management by triaging incoming messages and generating appropriate responses. The project is broken down into four key notebooks that cover the entire lifecycle of developing a robust AI agent.

Key Features and Concepts
1. Agent Architecture (agent.ipynb)
The project starts by building the foundational architecture of the email assistant using LangGraph. This involves creating a workflow that combines a router and a response agent:

Triage Router: This component analyzes incoming emails and classifies them into one of three categories: respond, ignore, or notify. This initial step prevents the assistant from wasting resources on irrelevant emails and helps prioritize important messages.

Response Agent: If an email is classified as respond, it is passed to this agent, which is responsible for generating a response. The agent uses a set of tools to perform actions like writing emails, checking calendar availability, and scheduling meetings.

2. Evaluating Agents (evaluation.ipynb)
Once the basic agent is built, the project moves on to the critical step of evaluation. This notebook demonstrates how to use LangSmith to test the agent's performance and ensure it will work well in a production environment. Two primary methods of testing are explored:

Pytest Integration: This method is used for more complex evaluations where each test case requires specific checks and success criteria. The notebook shows how to write and run tests that log results to LangSmith, allowing developers to track metrics like response quality, token usage, and triage accuracy.

LangSmith Datasets: This approach involves creating a dataset of email examples and running the assistant against it using the LangSmith evaluate API. This is particularly useful for teams that are collaboratively building out their test suite and want to leverage production traces and annotation queues.

LLM-as-Judge: The notebook also showcases how to use a language model as a judge to evaluate the agent's performance against a set of success criteria. This is a powerful technique for getting a more nuanced understanding of the agent's behavior.

3. Human-in-the-Loop (hitl.ipynb)
Recognizing that an email assistant is a sensitive application, the project incorporates a human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanism to allow for human review of the agent's actions. This is achieved by adding an interrupt handler to the graph that pauses execution at specific points and awaits human input. The HITL flow allows users to:

Review and Accept: Users can review the agent's proposed actions (like sending an email or scheduling a meeting) and accept them as-is.

Edit: Users can edit the agent's proposed actions before they are executed, giving them precise control over the final outcome.

Provide Feedback: Users can provide feedback in natural language to guide the agent's behavior without having to make direct edits.

4. Memory (memory.ipynb)
The notebook in the series adds memory to the assistant, giving it the ability to remember user feedback and adapt its behavior over time. The project explores two types of memory in LangGraph:

Thread-Scoped Memory (Short-term): This memory operates within a single conversation thread and is used to maintain context within that conversation.

Across-Thread Memory (Long-term): This memory extends beyond individual conversations and creates a persistent knowledge base that spans multiple sessions. This allows the agent to learn and adapt over time, rather than treating each interaction as isolated.
