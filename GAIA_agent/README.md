This project implements a tool-augmented AI agent, demonstrating how to set up a development environment, integrate external knowledge bases via vector stores, define and utilize various tools, and orchestrate complex reasoning workflows using LangGraph and large language models. The project creates a robust question-answering system capable of utilizing various tools and a vector database for enhanced retrieval.

Key aspects of the project include:

* **Vector Database Integration:** The notebook demonstrates building and interacting with a vector database (Supabase) using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` (specifically `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`) to embed question-answer pairs from a `metadata.jsonl` file. It covers wrapping metadata into LangChain `Document` objects, inserting them into the Supabase `documents` table, and performing similarity searches to retrieve relevant information. A PostgreSQL function `match_documents_langchain` is also defined for efficient vector similarity search within Supabase.
* **Agent Architecture (LangGraph):** The core of the AI agent is built using `langgraph.graph.StateGraph`, defining a state machine that orchestrates the interaction between the assistant and various tools.
    * **Assistant Node:** An `assistant` node uses `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (specifically `gemini-2.0-flash`) to process messages and decide on actions, potentially invoking tools.
    * **Tool Node:** A `tools` node executes the selected tools.
    * **Conditional Edges:** The graph uses `tools_condition` to route messages: if the assistant's response involves tool calls, it goes to the `tools` node; otherwise, it ends the conversation.
* **Tool Definitions:** A comprehensive set of tools is defined using LangChain's `@tool` decorator, enabling the agent to perform various actions:
    * **Arithmetic Operations:** `multiply`, `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, `modulus`.
    * **Search Tools:** `wiki_search` (Wikipedia), `web_search` (Tavily), `arvix_search` (Arxiv), and `similar_search` (vector database lookup for similar questions).
