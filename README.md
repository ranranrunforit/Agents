## Agent Workflow Projects


**[Research Chat](./research_chat)**

Research Chat is an AI-powered research assistant designed to help users explore topics interactively through a chat interface. The application leverages the Gemini language model for generating insightful responses and integrates web search capabilities to provide up-to-date information.

**Key Libraries Used:**
- `Gradio`: Builds the web-based chat UI.
- `LangChain`, `LangGraph`: Orchestrate complex conversational flows and manage agent logic.
- `Google-GenAI`, `langchain-google-genai`: Accesses the Gemini language model for advanced natural language understanding and generation.
- `DuckDuckGo-Search`: Enables real-time web search to supplement AI-generated answers.
- `Requests`: Handles HTTP requests for external APIs.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables for configuration.
- `Pydantic`, `typing-extensions`: Provide data validation and type support.



**[Sidekick Personal Coworker](./sidekick_personal_coworker)**

These files implement an agentic assistant using LangGraph and LangChain. The assistant can autonomously complete tasks, use external tools (like web browsing and Python code execution), and iteratively improve its work based on evaluator feedback and user-defined success criteria.

- **`sidekick.py`** defines the agent's workflow, state management, and evaluation logic. It builds a stateful graph with nodes for working, tool usage, and evaluation, allowing the assistant to loop until the task is complete or more user input is needed.
- **`sidekick_tools.py`** provides tool definitions (such as Playwright-based web browsing and other custom tools) that the agent can invoke during its workflow.

**Key Libraries Used:**
- `langgraph`: For building stateful agent graphs (`StateGraph`, `ToolNode`, etc.).
- `langchain_openai`: For LLM access (`ChatOpenAI`) and tool binding.
- `langchain_core.messages`: For structured message handling (`SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`).
- `playwright_tools`, `other_tools`: Custom tool definitions for agent actions.
- `asyncio`, `uuid`, `datetime`: For async operations, unique IDs, and time-stamping.


**[Deep Research](./deep_research)**

This project demonstrates a Research Agent workflow using the OpenAI Agents SDK. The agent automates the process of planning, executing, and synthesizing web research, then delivers the results via email.

- Uses a `PlannerAgent` (based on the `Agent` class) to generate relevant search queries for a given research topic.  
- Employs the `WebSearchTool` to perform web searches for each planned query.
- A `WriterAgent` creates a detailed markdown report from the search results.
- Integrates SendGrid via the `send_email` function (decorated with `@function_tool`) to send the final report as a formatted HTML email.

**Key Libraries Used:**
- `OpenAI Agents SDK`: `Agent`, `WebSearchTool`, `Runner`, `trace`, `function_tool`
- `SendGrid`: For sending emails (`sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient`, `Mail`, `Email`, `To`, `Content`)
- `Asyncio`: For asynchronous execution of search and report tasks


**[Career Conversation with Rerun](./career_conversation_with_rerun)**

This project implements a professional chatbot web application using Gradio, OpenAI, and Pushover APIs. The chatbot represents AI representative and answers questions about his career, background, and experience. It loads profile and summary data from local files and uses the OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model for conversation. The app supports function calling for two tools: recording user contact details and logging unanswered questions. Push notifications are sent via the Pushover API when these tools are triggered.

**Key Libraries Used:**
- `gradio` (`gr.ChatInterface`): Builds the interactive web chat UI.
- `openai` (`OpenAI`): Handles LLM chat completions and function calling.
- `pypdf` (`PdfReader`): Reads and extracts text from PDF profile files.
- `requests`: Sends push notifications to Pushover.


**[GAIA Agent](./GAIA_agent)**

The project implements a tool-augmented AI agent for advanced question answering and reasoning. It integrates external knowledge bases, vector databases, and a suite of tools to enhance retrieval and reasoning capabilities.

- **Agent Architecture:**  Built using LangChain and LangGraph, the agent uses a state machine (`StateGraph`) to orchestrate interactions between the assistant (powered by `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` with Gemini 2.0 Flash) and various tools.
- **Vector Database Integration:**  Utilizes Supabase as a vector store, with embeddings generated by `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` (`sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`). Documents are stored and retrieved using similarity search via a custom PostgreSQL function (`match_documents_langchain`).
- **Tool Suite:**  Tools are defined using LangChain's `@tool` decorator, including arithmetic operations, Wikipedia search (`WikipediaLoader`), web search (`TavilySearchResults`), Arxiv search (`ArxivLoader`), and vector database lookup.

**Key Libraries Used:**
- `LangChain`: For agent and tool orchestration.
- `LangGraph`: To manage agent state and workflow.
- `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`: For embedding and similarity search.
- `Supabase`: As the vector database backend.
- `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`: For LLM-based responses.
